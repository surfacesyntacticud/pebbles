SUD shares with with UD its `compound` relation, though the exact usage of this relationship is determined on a language-by-language basis.
SUD annotations for some languages, such as French, do not use the `compound` relation at all.

Naija in particular makes heavy use of this relation, which is used to link nouns to virtually any other nouns which play a modifying role.
However, it is also used to annotate phrasal verbs as well as a more limited subset of relations between nouns and adjectives, such as *dry cleaner*, which are considered fixed expressions whose meaning cannot be directly understood from its constituent parts.
For more information, see @@@ [Naija's page](../../../../language/naija/syntax/compound_phrasal_verbs).

In many cases, the existence of a `compound` relation can be determined with a series of linguistic tests.
For example, it might be impossible to insert an adjective between two elements of a compound.
In English, `compound`s are phonologically distinct, pronounced with an intonation similar to that of a single word.
Consider the difference in pronunciation between *real estate*, a bona fide `compound`, and *real property*, an adjective and a noun connected with a simple `mod` relation.
