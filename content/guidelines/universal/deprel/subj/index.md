In SUD, the `subj` main relation is used for all subjects (either nominal which are `nsubj` in UD or clausal which are `csubj` in UD).

`subj` is never used with a subrelation.

Most of the times, [`subj`](./subj) is used without deep feature.
Possible deep feature extensions are:
 - [`subj@expl`](./subj@expl)
 - [`subj@caus`](./subj@caus)
 - [`subj@pass`](./subj@pass)

Other extensions appear during conversion from UD => SUD, UD subrelation are kept as "deep" SUD relation for information preserving.
For instance UD:`nsubj:cop` => SUD:`subj@cop`.
