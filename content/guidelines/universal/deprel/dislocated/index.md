The `dislocated` relation is used for fronted or postposed elements that do not fulfil the usual core grammatical relations of a sentence. Dislocated elements are attached to the same governor as the dependent that they double for.


The relation is frequently associated to a subrelation indicating the function corresponding to the dislocated element in the main clause:
 - [`dislocated:subj`](./dislocated:subj)
 - [`dislocated:obj`](./dislocated:obj)
 - [`dislocated:obl`](./dislocated:obl)
 - [`dislocated:mod`](./dislocated:mod)
 - [`dislocated`](./dislocated) without subrelation is used when the function is not annotated or unclear.
