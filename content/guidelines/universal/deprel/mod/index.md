In SUD, the `mod` relation is used for all modifiers (as opposed to UD set of label `amod`, `advmod`…).

Most of the times, [`mod`](./mod.md) is used without extension.
Frequent extensions are:
 - `mod@relcl`

Other extensions appear during conversion from UD => SUD, UD subrelation are kept as "deep" SUD relation for information preserving.
For instance, UD:`nmod:tmod` => SUD:`mod@tmod`.
