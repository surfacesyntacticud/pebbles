# `Scrap`

In spoken data, sometimes speakers utter a half-finished construction.
In that case, it may happen that a word cannot be attached to its head, because the speaker decided not to utter it.

In this example, the construction *Je lis son le portrait de notre de votre héros* (English: *I’m reading his the portrayal of our of your hero*) causes some issues because the word *notre* cannot be attached to its semantic head *héros* because of the presence of the second *de*.
For these cases, the two words *de* are linked with a `repair` relation and the word *notre* is linked to the first *de* as an incomplete object (`comp:obj`) with the feature `Scrap=Yes`.
