# Lexical features

Since version 2.18, a system of lexical features has been introduced to have a more fine-grained annotation of the status of the corresponding features.

The following lexical features are used (in French treebanks only for now):

 - `Gender[lex]`
 - `Gender[ctxt]`
 - `Number[lex]`
 - `Number[ctxt]`

In Spoken treebanks, the feature `Person[lex]` is also used.

> These lexical feature are not kept in conversion to UD.
> Instead, there are replaced by a secondary feature [Exponence]
