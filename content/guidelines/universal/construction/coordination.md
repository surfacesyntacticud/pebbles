In SUD, the dependency relation between conjuncts or a coordination is [`conj:coord`](guidelines/universal/deprel/conj:coord).

## Chained conjuncts
In SUD, when a coordination concerns more than two conjuncts, each conjunct is attached to the head of the previous one in a chain.
This helps to reduce cumbersome long-distance relations.
We also believe it to be a more accurate representation of the cognitive process of coordination.

<conll>
# lang = English
1	John	John	PROPN	_	_	6	subj	_	_
2	,	,	PUNCT	_	_	3	punct	_	_
3	Mary	Mary	PROPN	_	_	1	conj:coord	_	_
4	and	and	CCONJ	_	_	5	cc	_	_
5	Peter	Peter	PROPN	_	_	3	conj:coord	_	_
6	will	will	AUX	_	_	0	root	_	_
7	come	come	VERB	_	_	6	comp:aux	_	_
</conll>

Note that it is different from UD annotation where all conjuncts of a coordination are attached to the head of the first conjunct in a bouquet.

4	and	and	CCONJ	_	_	5	cc	_	_

6	will	will	AUX	_	_	7	aux	_	_
7	come	come	VERB	_	_	0	root	_	_
</conll>



## Embedded coordination
The conjunct of a coordination can itself be a coordination.
Theoretically, this embedding can be nested indefinitely.
In natural corpora, however, there is typically only one level of iteration.

The [`conj:coord`](guidelines/universal/deprel/conj:coord) label does not make a distinction between embedded relations and surface relations because they form a single chain.
However, these relations can be distinguished with the use of the extension [``@emb``](guidelines/deep/emb) for embedded coordinations.

2	,	,	PUNCT	_	_	3	punct	_	_
3	Mary	Mary	PROPN	_	_	1	conj:coord	_	highlight=red
4	or	or	CCONJ	_	_	6	cc	_	_

</conll>


## Shared dependents
Left dependents on coordination are attached to the head of the coordination. Since the head of a coordination is the head of the leftmost conjunct, it is not possible to distinguish these dependents from the own dependents of the leftmost conjunct.

Right dependents on a coordination are attached to the head of the rightmost conjunct, but they can be confused with the own dependents of this conjunct.

As a consequence, left and right dependents on a coordination can be marked with feature [`Shared`](guidelines/universal/feature/Shared) with value `Yes` and `No`,
The value `Yes` distinguishes them from the own dependents of the respective leftmost and rightmost conjuncts.
