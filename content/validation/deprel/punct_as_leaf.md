  pattern {
    X -[punct]-> Y;   %  If Y is a punct dependent
    Y -[^punct]-> Z   %  It must be a leaf (except with another punct deprel)

The `punct` deprel should end with a leaf, with a few exceptions for notation like *(…)* (see example below), where a `punct` can be followed by a `punct`. Any other relation is prohibited.
